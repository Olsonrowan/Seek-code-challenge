# Seek-code-challenge

Code challenge for Seekxr

Challenge:
Using three.js, create a web page that loads and renders a glTF model. Include some kind of UI that allows you to switch the render to a different glTF model.

Objective:
Demonstrate that you are capable of learning new technologies quickly and effectively.

TO RUN:

Clone repo and from there open index.html with live server - I used addon from Ritwick Dey on vscode.

The web application should be running on your localhost.

I chose to make it so you have to click on the object itself to change the scene. I used Threex.domevents to make the object itself have a click event.
the first scene is just a simple rotating eyeball I thought looked really cool so i decided to keep it, the second seen is the main character from my favorite show one piece.
I left the character cause it helped show with his rotating that you have to click the object itself to swap scenes rather than anywhere else on the screen.
